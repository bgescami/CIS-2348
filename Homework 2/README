What this coding problem wanted us to do was very different than the last one. It wanted us to open a .txt file in our code, read the data that was in the code as a string, 
and then create a list of what was found in the file. we then run the file through a loop which will then pick and choose the dates that are formmatted the way we want them
formatted. It then prints these dates that fit the wanted criteria into a new parsedData.txt file. There is never anything that the IDE prints to the user. If you follow the directory
you will now see a new parsedDate.txt
