This homework assignment, although long and tedious, did help me to understand the purpose of classes, lists, and how to use them efficiently.
I had a long and rough time with Lab 10.19. I feel it was entirely to picky with the output, and was not worth my time to pick out specific
issues that zybook wanted to focus and take points on. After zylab 10.19 though, I felt like the labs after that were a breeze. I am interested to see 
how this homework is graded! Thank you for grading my work. :)
